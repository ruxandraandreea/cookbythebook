Here is a basic recipe for making cheese at home:

## Ingredients:

* 1 gallon of whole milk
* 1 tsp of citric acid
* 1/4 tsp of liquid animal rennet or 1/4 rennet tablet
* 1 tsp of salt
* Cheese cloth
* Cheese mold or plastic container

## Instructions:

1. Heat the milk: Pour the milk into a large pot and heat it to 88°F, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching.
2. Add citric acid: Dissolve the citric acid in 1/4 cup of cool water, then add it to the warm milk. Stir until well combined.
3. Add rennet: Dissolve the rennet in 1/4 cup of cool water, then add it to the warm milk. Stir gently for 30 seconds.
4. Let the curd set: Cover the pot and let it sit undisturbed for 30-60 minutes, or until the curd has set and is firm to the touch.
5. Cut the curd: Using a long knife, cut the curd into 1-inch squares.
6. Cook the curd: Place the pot back on the stove and heat it to 102°F, stirring gently. Hold the temperature for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. Drain the whey: Line a colander with cheesecloth and place it over a large bowl. Pour the curds and whey into the colander and let it drain for 10 minutes.
8. Salt the cheese: Sprinkle salt over the cheese curds and mix gently.
9. Mold the cheese: Put the cheese curds into a cheese mold or a plastic container, pressing down gently to remove any air pockets. Cover and let it sit at room temperature for 6-12 hours, or until it has set into a solid block of cheese.
10. Age the cheese: Store the cheese in a cool, damp place for 1-2 weeks, turning it over daily to prevent mold from forming. You can also wrap it in wax paper and store it in the refrigerator for up to a month.

Enjoy your homemade cheese! This recipe makes a basic fresh cheese that can be flavored and aged further, depending on your preferences.
