Prep time: 10-15 mins

Cook time: 20 mins

Servings: 4 to 5 people 

## I﻿ngredients

* 6 large potatoes, peeled and diced
* 4 tbsp. olive oil
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 1/2 cups grated Emmental cheese
* 1 1/2 cups grated Gruyere cheese
* 1/2 cup white wine
* 3 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 tbsp. cornstarch
* 1 tsp. honey
* 1 tsp. dried chili flakes
* Crusty bread, for dipping

## M﻿ethod

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, toss the diced potatoes with 2 tbsp. of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread the potatoes evenly on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.
3. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, heat the remaining 2 tbsp. of olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.
4. In a separate bowl, mix together the grated Emmental and Gruyere cheeses, white wine, and cornstarch. Pour the mixture into the saucepan with the garlic.
5. Stir the cheese mixture continuously over medium heat until the cheese has melted and the sauce is smooth and thick, about 5-7 minutes.
6. Stir in the honey and dried chili flakes.
7. Transfer the cheese sauce to a fondue pot or a 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with the roasted potatoes.
8. Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is hot and bubbly.
9. Serve the baked fondue with crusty bread for dipping. Enjoy the combination of creamy, cheesy, and spicy flavors with the crispy roast potatoes!
