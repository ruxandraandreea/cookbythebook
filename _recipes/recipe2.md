## Ingredients

* 4 large potatoes
* 8 oz (230g) streaky bacon, diced
* 1 1/2 cups (350ml) heavy cream
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 2 tbsp. fresh thyme leaves
* 1 cup (200g) freshly grated Gruyere cheese
* 1 cup (200g) freshly grated Emmental cheese
* 1 cup (200g) freshly grated Comté cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 190°C/ 375°F.
2. Slice the potatoes into 1/8 inch (3mm) rounds and set aside in a bowl filled with cold water. To keep cold longer, add ice to the water.
3. In a skillet, cook the diced bacon until crispy, then set aside.
4. In a saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat with the minced garlic and thyme leaves. Cook for 2-3 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant. You can add the bacon grease to the saucepan at this stage. 
5. In a 9x13-inch baking dish, layer half of the potato slices. Sprinkle with half of the cooked bacon and 1/3 of each of the grated cheeses. Repeat with another layer of potatoes, bacon, and cheese.
6. Pour the heavy cream mixture over the layered potatoes and cheese, making sure to evenly distribute the liquid.
7. Cover the baking dish with aluminium foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes, until the top is golden brown and the potatoes are tender.
8. Serve hot, garnished with fresh thyme leaves and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Enjoy the creamy, cheesy, and bacon-filled dauphinoise!

## T﻿ips

* For best results, slice the potatoes thinly with a hand mandoline. 
* I﻿f you have a lot of time on your hands, you can pre-boil your potato slices in the cream-herb mixture. This ensures the potatoes are served extra-soft. 
* A﻿lthough it needs to be served hot, it is best to let the dish rest at least 10 minutes after baking. This ensures the sauce stays creamy and thick.
